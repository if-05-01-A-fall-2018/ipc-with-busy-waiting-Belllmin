1.) Race Condition

    A race condition or race hazard is a scenario in an electronic processing system where 
    the result of a calculation might be affected by an uncontrolled sequence of events.


2.) a) Why is it impossible to achieve Mutual Exclusion via disabling interrupts on a multi-core machine?

    Because in multi-processor system, each CPU/core execute code simultaneously,
    so whether the current CPU has disabled interrupts has nothing to do
    to avoid other CPU from entering the same region.


    b) Why is it dangerous to give user processes the power to disable interrupts?
   
    1.It is dangerous because it is unwise to give user processes the power to turn off interrupts. Suppose
    that one of them did, and then never turned them on again?

    2.Furthermore, if the system is a multiprocessor, with two or more CPUs, disabling interrupts affects
    only the CPU that executed the disable instruction. The other ones will continue running and can access
    the shared memory.


3.) What is the meaning of the variable loser in Peterson's solution? When does it have any effect?

    The “loser” of the race is the process that updates last and will
    determine the final value of the variable.
